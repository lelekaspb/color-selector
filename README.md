The app stores the chosen color and harmony in an object and refers to the object every time a user changes color or harmony.

For every change, the app calculates colors, outputs harmony visually, in HEX, RGB, and HSL.

When users open the page, a random color and analogous harmony are chosen, and corresponding colors are rendered in a browser.
